# Car-management-application

In order to apply the concepts learned in the OOP course, I developed a C++ application that manages cars and offers basic functionality such as adding, updating, deleting, and searching for a car. Additionally, the application offers different filters to sort the list of vehicles and a method that allows you to add cars to a car wash list and then export them to a file. 
The information about cars is retrieved from a file, the graphical user interface was created using the Qt framework, and the application uses a layered architecture.
