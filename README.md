# Car-management-application

In order to apply the concepts learnt at OOP course I developed a C++ application that manages cars and offer basic functionality such as add, update, delete and search a car. Also, the application offers different filter to sort the list of vehicle and a method through which you can add cars to car wash list and then export them in a file. 
The information about cars is retrieved from a file, the graphical user interface was created using the Qt framework, and the application uses a layered architecture.
